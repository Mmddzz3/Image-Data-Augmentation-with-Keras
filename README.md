# Image Data Augmentation with Keras
 - To get started with what is  **Data Augmentation** I implemented  Image Data Augmentation with Keras.
 - Majorly used **Image Data Generator** with a Keras Model

- Following steps were performed in order to achieve the end results and improve the accuracy :
   - [x] Imported Libraries
   - [x] Rotation
   - [x] Width and Height Shifts
   - [x] Brightness
   - [x] Shear Transformation
   - [x] Zoom
   - [x] Channel Shift
   - [x] Horizontal and Vertical Flips
   - [x] Data Normalization
   - [x] Rescale and Preprocessing Function
   - [x] Used Model Training
